Putki is the gui system that dan is developing...

How to make it work:
	Build compiler:
		- Enter the "compiler"-folder
		- generate the project (premake4.exe -> premake4.lua file)
	
	Open the solution file (compiler.sln?):
		- properties
		- working directory (point to your project path (test-project))
		- command arguments | test_project
		
		- run project (generates a _gen-folder) inside test-project
		- generate a solution for that project (premake4.exe -> premake4.lua file inside folder)
		- open that solution (test-projekt.sln?) & compile it
		
		
	- test-projekt data builder
		- (working directory | projektets folder)
		- compile that solution (generates an "out" folder)
		
	- test-projekt runtime
		- working directory | projektets folder
		
	- Editor (needs data.dll from project)
		- premake solution (premake4.exe -> ...)
		- in solution
			- App.xaml.cs 			-> write in path to dll-file
			- FileBrowser.xaml.cs 	-> write in path to ...
		
	- To change what items that are created - write to "data-objs" to create objects (no idea what that is and where to find it, but it is somewhere there with a similar name)
	
	- CCG-UI - example for a UI (non working but should be working sometime)
	- Claw -  example for a game... (same as above)
